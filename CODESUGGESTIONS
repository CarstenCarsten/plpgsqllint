Header file order (taken from stackoverflow)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My personal preference is to go from local to global, each subsection in 
alphabetical order, i.e.:

1. h file corresponding to this cpp file (if applicable)
2. headers from the same component,
3. headers from other components,
4. system headers.

My rationale for 1. is that it should prove that each header (for which there
is a cpp) can be #included without prerequisites. And the rest just seems to
flow logically from there.
